    "image-proc-circle-desc": "This is a wrapper I did write for <b>TEKNOFEST International Unmanned Aerial Vehicles - Drone Category</b> 2020 competition's second task. This wrapper works in two steps. First, a filtering is done using HSV color range of desired color in HSV color space. Then extracting the contour areas and their details such as area position, size, etc. After this; based on distance of contour area center points, their mean values will be calculated and will be combined into single point. This point represents the point of interest that will be cropped from original frame using some arbitrary dimension and will be given into <b>HoughCircles</b> circle detection function of OpenCV as a parameter. The main reason for cropping the point of interest from the original frame using some arbitrary dimension is, applying <b>HoughCircles</b> circle detection method on original frame would be much more slower than just detecting the circles in point of interest. Especially considering original frame is a 1920x1080 frame meanwhile cropped point of interest would be something around 500x500. Then; as second step, detected circle center points in point of interest frame will be combined into one point based on their center points' distance between other circles' center points. Then this single combined center point will be combined with the center point of the combined contour areas into single point. This final point will be the detected cirle's center point.",

    "mesh-network-home-title": "Home Automation with Mesh Network",
    "mesh-network-home-desc": "In this project, a mesh network has been created for published data from several sensors that are placed separately from each other in order to reach the <b>System on Chip</b> system in the house that is acting as a server. These sensor data will then be published to the mobile application that is connected to the server via <b>Websocket</b>. I choosed <b>Raspberry PI 3</b> as <b>SoC</b> because of it's cheap price. <b>painlessMesh</b> library is used for creating the mesh network. <b>NodeMCU</b> IoT platform is used for the nodes in mesh network. Mobile application connects to the server using it's local IP address in WiFi network. Communication between root node and server is done by using <b>ROS</b>. Root node sends all sensor data from child nodes via <b>ROS Serial</b> library. Root node is connected to the server via physical cable. Reason of this is <b>NodeMCU</b> being unable to connect more than one WiFi network. (Meanwhile <b>painlessMesh</b> itself creates an access point, <b>ROS Serial</b> library attempts to connect to an exist WiFi network. This causes these two library to conflict with each other.) Mobile application is developed using <b>Xamarin Forms</b> to be cross-platform application.",

In addition, I used <b>Cordova</b> to create a mobile webview application for <b>Android</b> using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>Javascript</b>. All of the sensor data can be tracked in this application. This application also allows user to extensively update settings of all components. Such as updating sensor status (activated / deactivated), changing their polling rates and even adding sleep time (this can be useful to prevent notification spam for sensors like movement detection sensor as <b>NodeMCU</b> sends notification to the application every time sensor is triggered).",
